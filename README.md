# Latitude

A globe-style world + latitude-based biome bands with a customizable compass HUD and warnings.

## Current 1.4 status

The current Latitude 1.4 source of truth is the Minecraft `26.1.2` worktree at `/Users/joolmac/CascadeProjects/Latitude-custom-biome-expansion-26.1.2`. Use [docs/release/checklist.md](/Users/joolmac/CascadeProjects/Latitude%20(Globe)/docs/release/checklist.md) as the permanent rerun front door and [docs/release/scenic-drive-green-checklist.md](/Users/joolmac/CascadeProjects/Latitude%20(Globe)/docs/release/scenic-drive-green-checklist.md) for the live scenic pass. This checkout remains the main docs/history root and still contains older `1.21.11`-era build metadata.

## Features

- **Latitude biome bands** via biome tags under `globe:lat_*`.
- **Warning overlays** (e.g. pole / edge warnings).
- **Compass HUD**
  - Toggle keybind: `K`
  - Open settings: `F9`
  - Preview mode toggle: `P`
  - Alt+Left-Click a compass icon in inventory to toggle (shows a red X when disabled)
  - Fully configurable: anchors, offsets, scale, background alpha, colors, show modes, direction modes

## Design Spec / Release Gate
See: docs/design-spec.md

## Guardrails / Workflows
- Savepoint Autopilot: `.windsurf/workflows/latitude-savepoint-autopilot.md`

## Dependencies

- Current Latitude 1.4 candidate: Fabric Loader for Minecraft `26.1.2` in `/Users/joolmac/CascadeProjects/Latitude-custom-biome-expansion-26.1.2`
- This checkout's `gradle.properties` still describes the historical `1.21.11` / `1.3.0` line and is not the active 1.4 release source of truth.
- Fabric API

## Biome tag integration

This mod selects biomes for latitude bands via biome tags:

- `globe:lat_equator`
- `globe:lat_tropical`
- `globe:lat_temperate`
- `globe:lat_subpolar`
- `globe:lat_polar`

Biome mods can integrate by adding their biomes into these tags.

## Config

Compass HUD configuration is stored in:

- `config/globe_compass_hud.json`

## Building

```powershell
.\gradlew.bat clean build
```

The release jar to upload is in:

- `build/libs/` (the remapped main jar, not `-dev` / `-sources`)

For Latitude 1.4 readiness, build from the canonical `26.1.2` worktree named above, not from this historical `1.21.11` checkout.
