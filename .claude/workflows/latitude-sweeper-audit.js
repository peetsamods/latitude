// "Sweeper" adversarial audit — standing/reusable practice (established 2026-07-05 per Peetsa's
// instruction after the live 18N classifyBase-fallthrough bug; see LESSONS L14 in the main worktree
// and docs/binder/biome-consumer-sweeper-fixes-20260705.md for the audit this template was cut from).
//
// WHAT THIS IS: fan out N independent finder agents (each given a different adversarial LENS over the
// same scope), then independently verify every raw finding with a skeptical agent that defaults to
// REFUTING unless it can directly confirm the defect by reading the real code. Only CONFIRMED/PLAUSIBLE
// findings survive. This exists because L14 showed that logical/aggregate reasoning about "the flag is
// off so it's fine" or "the test passed" is not enough — a silent fallthrough can pass every existing
// check and still be a live bug.
//
// HOW TO REUSE FOR A NEW SWEEP:
//   CONFIRMED 2026-07-05: Workflow({ name: 'latitude-sweeper-audit', args }) does NOT resolve this
//   repo-local file — the tool reported only the built-ins ("Available: deep-research, code-review")
//   even with this file committed at .claude/workflows/latitude-sweeper-audit.js. Do not spend time
//   retrying name+args resolution; it is not wired up in this environment as of this date. This is
//   consistent with an EARLIER, separate args failure this same day (an args-array field threw
//   "undefined is not an object (evaluating 'lenses.length')", 0 agents ran) for a bug never
//   root-caused — two independent signals pointing the same direction.
//   ALWAYS DO THIS INSTEAD: copy this whole file's body into a `Workflow({ script: ... })` call,
//   replacing the `const a = args || {}` block (and the lines derived from it) with literal
//   repoRoot/scopeLabel/scopeBrief/lenses values for your new sweep — exactly the pattern
//   latitude-sweeper-audit-biome-consumer-wf_d0c82c96-3d7.js and
//   latitude-sweeper-audit-phases-0-3-wf_9c9dbfa8-fec.js both used successfully. This file stays as
//   the canonical, indexed TEMPLATE (lens design, schemas, find->verify->synthesize shape) even though
//   it cannot be invoked by name — keep it in sync with whichever inline copy you last refined.
//
// SCOPING A GOOD SWEEP: scopeBrief should name exact files/methods in scope and, if there's a known bug,
// describe its precise mechanism so lenses can look for the SAME failure class elsewhere (not just the
// one instance). lenses should be genuinely different angles (exhaustiveness-of-a-cascade,
// test-validity, a specific recurring risk pattern in this codebase, flag-gating correctness,
// docs-vs-code contradiction, freeform adversarial-scenario construction) — 5-6 lenses has been the
// right size so far; more dilutes each agent's read time, fewer misses angles.
//
// MODEL: always Opus, high effort, for BOTH find and verify agents — this is exactly the kind of
// judgment-heavy, must-not-miss-or-hallucinate work that warrants top-tier model+effort (see
// model-effort-strategy-20260702.md). Do not downgrade to save cost; a missed live-worldgen bug costs
// far more than the extra tokens.
