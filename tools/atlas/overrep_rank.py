"""Per-biome over-representation ranker for a Latitude atlas run (the #3 gate).

The runBiomePreview audit emits one biome-audit_*.csv per step dir with a
`selected_land_bands` column formatted like "subtropical=805;tropical=369"
(one band=count pair per latitude band the biome was selected in, ';'-separated;
bands are polar / subpolar / temperate / subtropical / tropical). This script
turns that column into a repeatable green/red over-representation check instead
of the ad-hoc parsing used in the recon.

It reports, for every LAND biome:
  - overall land %   = biome's total land count / all LAND samples
  - within-band %    = biome's count in its DOMINANT band / all LAND in that band
                       (the truest over-rep measure: a biome can own 2/3 of polar
                        land while looking modest overall)
and a verdict against the proposed acceptance gate, plus the tropical humid-family
share that the equator is supposed to keep majority.

Land/water split: any biome id containing "ocean" or "river" is classed as water
and EXCLUDED from the land denominators (ocean/river rows still carry land-band
counts in the CSV, so they must be filtered or the percentages are wrong).

Parsing approach is the one proven in
tmp/1.4.1-prep-20260621/overrep/overrep-ranking.md (sections (a) and (e)).
stdlib only — no numpy/PIL needed (this reads the CSV, not the PNGs).

Usage:  python3 overrep_rank.py <atlas-step-dir>
  where <atlas-step-dir> contains a biome-audit_*.csv
