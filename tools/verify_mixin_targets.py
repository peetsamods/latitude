"""Statically verify that every registered mixin's target class and method actually exist.

A green build does not prove a mixin applies. Mixin resolves its targets at class-load time, so a
renamed or moved target is invisible to javac and only surfaces when the game boots -- which on a
port is exactly the failure you want to catch before staging a jar.

This closes most of that gap without a client: it reads `globe.mixins.json`, resolves each mixin's
`@Mixin` target and every injector's `method = "..."` and `@At(target = "L...;name(...)...")`
against the *remapped* Minecraft jar Loom built for this target, and reports anything missing.

It also checks that every `@Shadow` and explicit `@Accessor` names a member the target class
DECLARES. Mixin resolves both at class-load time, so a renamed, removed, or inherited-only member
compiles clean, passes `check`, and then fails at apply time. That gap was described in this file
for a while before `@Shadow` was covered; an unchecked accessor later caused the same failure
shape on the 1.21.1 client.

Scope is per registered CLASS, never per file: one file may hold several top-level mixins with
different targets, and pooling their members lets a member declared on one target satisfy a
`@Shadow`, injector, or `@At` belonging to another. That is a false negative in exactly the shape
above, so `@Mixin` targets, `@Shadow`s, injectors and `@At`s are all read from the class body.

It also checks every injector HANDLER's declared parameters against the shape Mixin demands at
apply time: the target's parameter types plus the injector's own extras (CallbackInfo or
CallbackInfoReturnable, the Operation<> of a wrap, a wrapped call's receiver and arguments). Names
were matched before; descriptors were not, so a handler whose parameter list drifted on a port
passed here and then threw InvalidInjectionException at class load. Explicit descriptors in
`method = "name(...)"` are resolved exactly rather than reduced to the name.

It is not a substitute for a boot: it cannot prove an injection point exists *inside* a method
(a `@At("INVOKE")` whose target call was removed). Run it first, then boot. And assert the boot
actually reached the screen -- "zero mixin errors" from a run that never loaded the class is
worth nothing. `defaultRequire: 1` remains the backstop.

# A name match is not an apply. Mixin resolves an injector's `method` selector against the
# target class's OWN methods and then checks the handler's JVM descriptor against the shape its
# injector contract demands. A handler whose parameter list no longer matches -- a parameter
# dropped on a port, CallbackInfo where CallbackInfoReturnable is required, a missing
# Operation<> -- compiles clean, passes every name check above, and throws
# InvalidInjectionException at class load. On the dedicated server that surfaces as "Failed to
# start the minecraft server" with exit code 0, which is how this gap stayed open: the name-only
# pass here reported MIXIN_TARGET_VERIFY_PASS while the headless run died at boot.
#
# The rules below are transcribed from the Mixin 0.8.7 and MixinExtras 0.5 sources, not from
# memory:
#   @Inject            CallbackInjector.Callback.checkDescriptor: (targetArgs..., CI)V or the
#                      short form (CI)V; with `locals =` the captured locals follow CI. With
#                      several candidate targets Mixin only fails when NONE of them matches.
#   @Redirect, @ModifyVariable, @ModifyConstant, @WrapOperation, @WrapWithCondition,
#   @ModifyReturnValue, @ModifyExpressionValue
#                      Injector.validateParams: an exact head (per injector) followed, at most,
#                      by a PREFIX of the target method's own arguments; anything beyond that is
#                      "unexpected additional method arguments".
#   @WrapMethod        WrapMethodInjector.checkSignature: exactly (targetArgs..., Operation)ret.
#   @ModifyArg         ModifyArgInjector: (T)T, or (all invoked args)T.
#   @ModifyArgs        ModifyArgsInjector.verifyTarget: (Args)V or (Args, targetArgs...)V.
# MixinExtras sugar (@Local, @Share, @Cancellable) is stripped before those checks and must be
# trailing; @Coerce widens one position to anything.
#
# Whatever the rules cannot decide from source plus javap -- captured locals, a field redirect
# without an opcode, a `method = "*"` selector, a type variable -- is counted UNVERIFIABLE and
# reported as such, never folded into PASS or FAIL. Handler parameter types are compared by
