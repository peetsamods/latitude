/**
 * Nothing grows in the alpine snow cap (maintainer ruling, 2026-08-15).
 *
 * <p>{@link AlpineSurfaceMixin} rewrites high natural surfaces into alpine rock or snow, and its
 * note argued that the snow zone therefore leaves no grass block for vegetation to root in, so
 * nothing could poke through. That holds for the surface pass and only the surface pass. Decoration
 * runs afterwards with plants of its own, and saved chunks showed grass, cornflowers and tulips
 * standing directly on {@code snow_block} well above the height where the cap is unconditional —
 * the ground was already snow when the feature placed on it. The cap decides what the ground is; it
 * never had a say over what decoration puts on top.
 *
 * <p><b>Why the block write.</b> Same reasoning as
 * {@link ProtoChunkPolarVegetationGuardMixin}: feature classes are an unbounded set, and
 * enumerating them is exactly what left fallen trees, huge mushrooms and modded shrubs outside the
 * polar guard. Guarding the write cannot be outflanked by a feature type nobody has enumerated.
 *
 * <p><b>Determinism.</b> Cancelling here cannot desynchronise worldgen: the feature has already run
 * and consumed its randomness by the time it asks the chunk to store a block. Only whether the
 * resulting block is kept changes.
 *
 * <p><b>Scope.</b> Ground cover only. Woody content above the same height is already refused by the
 * tree line, which sits at the alpine rock line, so this guard deliberately does not repeat that
 * tier. Terrain, snow, ice and fluids are neither tagged foliage nor {@code BushBlock}s, so
 * the test cannot erase the cap it is protecting.
