/**
 * Adds a small "Vanilla" door beside Create New World on the Select World screen: a one-click route
 * straight to vanilla's own create-world screen, skipping Latitude's. Today that path is two clicks
 * (Create New World -> Latitude's screen -> Other World Types); this is the direct door. Both
 * existing routes stay -- nothing is replaced.
 *
 * <p>Explicitly not a split-button or chevron on Create New World itself: that button is the one
 * everyone aims for, which makes it the worst possible place to add a target for a stray click, and
 * dropdown menus are not a Minecraft idiom.</p>
 *
 * <p>Play is taken from vanilla's own {@code selectButton} field; Create has no field
 * ({@code selectWorld.create} is built inline) and is found by message among
 * {@link Screen#children()}. That asymmetry is deliberate and was paid for: an earlier version
 * matched BOTH by message "for one lookup loop instead of two", and vanilla rewrites the Play
 * button's label through {@code updateButtonStatus} on every selection change, so the match broke
 * the moment a world was selected and the door hid itself. Create's label is never rewritten, so
 * matching it by message is sound. <b>Match a widget by message only where nothing rewrites that
 * message</b> -- and prefer a field wherever vanilla offers one.</p>
 *
 * <p>Runs from {@code init} alone on this target, and that is enough here -- verified in bytecode
 * that 1.21.1's {@code Screen.resize} calls {@code repositionElements()}, whose default body is
 * {@code rebuildWidgets()}: {@code clearWidgets()} followed by a full {@code init()}. The newer
 * lines gate {@code init()} behind a hidden {@code initialized} flag and route resizes to
 * {@code repositionElements()} only, which is why they need the second hook; 1.21.1 does not, and
 * {@code SelectWorldScreen} does not override {@code repositionElements}, so there is nothing there
 * to hook. The trade is that {@code clearWidgets} drops the door on every resize, so the retained
 * reference has to be released at init's HEAD -- see {@code globe$dropStaleDoorBeforeRebuild}.
 * Either way the hook runs after vanilla has (re)arranged its own footer, so Play and Create's
 * coordinates are final by the time this reads them.</p>
 *
 * <p>Play, Create, and the door are narrowed together to share the span of the FOUR-button row
 * below them (Edit / Delete / Re-Create / Back) -- not appended past Create's edge with a
 * refuse-if-no-room fallback, which is what an earlier version of this door did and which was
 * reported live as absent at a window that looked perfectly ordinary on screen. Narrowing has no
 * such threshold: nothing beyond what the footer already claims is ever requested, so the door is
 * present whenever Play and Create are.</p>
 *
 * <p>Both the span and the left edge come from that lower row specifically, and that is the whole
 * design. This code resizes Play and Create, and vanilla's footer GridLayout derives its own column
 * widths from its children's widths, so ANY measurement taken off Play or Create is an output of
 * this method's previous pass rather than an input -- which is exactly how two earlier versions
 * failed live, one collapsing the row and one letting it drift during a resize. The four buttons
 * below are never written to here, so they are the only trustworthy reference on this screen, and
 * aligning to them also makes the two rows share an edge by construction rather than by
 * arithmetic.</p>

        // the envelope live, as the previous version did, measures a row this code shrank on the

        // World" label and a row visibly misaligned with the four buttons beneath it.
