/**
 * Block-level polar vegetation guard — the backstop the feature-class guards structurally cannot be.
 *
 * <p>{@link com.example.globe.mixin.ExtremePolarVegetationGuardMixin} cancels {@code TreeFeature}
 * and {@link com.example.globe.mixin.ExtremePolarSimpleFoliageGuardMixin} cancels
 * {@code SimpleBlockFeature}. Both are kept — cancelling a tree before it writes anything is
 * cheaper and cleaner than deleting its blocks one at a time, and the simple-block guard
 * deliberately lets {@code getState} run first so the {@code RandomSource} advances exactly as
 * vanilla would. But between them they name two feature classes out of an unbounded set, and the
 * gap was load-bearing:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>{@code minecraft:fallen_tree} is {@code FallenTreeFeature extends Feature} — a SIBLING of
 *       {@code TreeFeature}, not a subclass — so felled trunks placed above the limit with no packs
 *       installed, and its {@code log_decorators} rode brown/red mushrooms in on top of them. That
 *       is the reported symptom: standing trees forbidden, logs and mushrooms present anyway.</li>
 *   <li>BOP's fallen-log family, {@code patch_tundra_shrubs} (up to 288 attempts per chunk), reeds,
 *       toadstools, huge mushrooms, {@code multiface_growth} glow lichen and {@code block_column}
 *       sugar cane are all raw {@code Feature}s too.</li>
 *   <li>{@code globe:polar_foliage} listed {@code #minecraft:logs} the whole time and it changed
 *       nothing, because the tag had exactly one reader and that reader only ever sees
 *       {@code SimpleBlockFeature}.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>Guarding the block WRITE closes every one of those at once and cannot be outflanked by a
 * feature type nobody has enumerated yet. {@code ProtoChunk.setBlockState} is the same write path
 * Latitude already guards for warm-band snow, so this is a proven interception point rather than a
 * new one.
 *
 * <p><b>Determinism.</b> Cancelling here cannot desynchronise worldgen: the feature has already run
 * and consumed its randomness by the time it asks the chunk to store a block. Nothing about the
 * {@code RandomSource} sequence changes — only whether the resulting block is kept.
 *
 * <p><b>Fails closed, without depending on pack contents.</b> A tag-only test fails OPEN on any
 * modded block the pack never added to a vanilla tag, which is how BOP tundra shrubs and reeds
 * survived while the vanilla grass and ferns beside them were stripped — leaving the polar cap
 * looking MORE vegetated than a correctly-guarded biome. {@code VegetationBlock} is the vanilla
 * plant base; BOP's own {@code VegetationBlockBOP} extends it, as do its flower, mushroom, sapling
 * and double-plant blocks, so modded ground cover is caught by inheritance rather than by
 * enumeration. Fluids, snow, ice, terrain and logs are not {@code VegetationBlock}s, so the test
 * cannot erase the world it is standing on.
