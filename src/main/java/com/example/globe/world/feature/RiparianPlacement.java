/**
 * Keeps a decoration position only where an arid biome meets fresh water, and only inside the
 * coherent stretches of waterline that the world seed marks verdant.
 *
 * <p>This is a decoration filter and nothing else. It never reports a biome, never changes one,
 * and refuses outright unless {@link LatitudeWorldgenScope} says Latitude owns the generator that
 * is currently decorating, so a datapack cannot borrow it into another dimension.</p>
 *
 * <p>The gate is deliberately two-part (maintainer ruling, 2026-08-19: "planting only", and not
 * everywhere):</p>
 * <ul>
 *   <li><b>Water proximity</b> - a bounded sweep of columns ordered by true distance, never a radius-squared
 *       sweep. Rings are walked outward and the search stops at the first hit, so the answer is
 *       the true distance to the waterline and a bank column pays only the few probes it takes to
 *       find its own water. The predecessor probed sixteen fixed columns (eight compass directions
 *       at two distances); that stencil left holes wide enough for a genuine bank column seven
 *       blocks from a river to read as dry, which is what made verdant reaches print as dotted
 *       blobs rather than continuous banks (live find, 2026-08-25).</li>
 *   <li><b>Distance taper</b> - inside the core distance every qualifying column greens; beyond it
 *       the survival chance falls to zero at the search radius, so a reach fades out as it climbs
 *       away from the water instead of ending at a hard rim.</li>
 *   <li><b>Coherence</b> - one {@link ValueNoise2D} sample at a low frequency, so a verdant bank
 *       runs for hundreds of blocks instead of speckling block by block. Article VI: the
 *       coherence comes from seeded value noise, never from cell hashing.</li>
 * </ul>
