/**

 * coherent stretches of waterline that the world seed marks verdant.
 *
 * <p>This is a decoration filter and nothing else. It never reports a biome, never changes one,
 * and refuses outright unless {@link LatitudeWorldgenScope} says Latitude owns the generator that
 * is currently decorating, so a datapack cannot borrow it into another dimension.</p>
 *
 * <p>The gate is deliberately two-part (maintainer ruling, 2026-08-19: "planting only", and not
 * everywhere):</p>
 * <ul>
 *   <li><b>Water proximity</b> - a bounded, distance-ordered ring sweep, never a radius-squared
 *       scan. Probes are walked nearest-first through the world-surface heightmap and stop at the
 *       first hit, so a bank column answers in a handful of reads and only a genuinely dry column
 *       pays for the whole table. The hit distance is kept, not merely a yes/no, because planting
 *       density tapers with it.</li>
 *   <li><b>Coherence</b> - one {@link ValueNoise2D} sample at a low frequency, so a verdant bank
 *       runs for hundreds of blocks instead of speckling block by block. Article VI: the
 *       coherence comes from seeded value noise, never from cell hashing.</li>
