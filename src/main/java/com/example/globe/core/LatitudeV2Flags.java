/**
 * Feature flags gating the Phase 2 (GeoAuthority), Phase 3 (ClimateAuthority), and Biome Consumer
 * slices of the Latitude 2.0 overhaul. All default to {@code false}.
 *
 * <p>{@link #GEO_V2_ENABLED} / {@link #CLIMATE_V2_ENABLED} gate whether each authority is
 * constructed and sampled at all (Phase 2/3: computed-and-discarded). {@link #BIOME_CONSUMER_V2_ENABLED}
 * is a separate, later flag: it gates whether the computed summaries actually CHANGE biome selection.
 * Kept distinct on purpose -- the geoV2/climateV2 flags have an established, tested contract from
 * Phases 2-3 ("computed and discarded, zero biome change"); overloading them to also mean "and drives
 * biomes" would silently break that contract. The consumer flag depends on its authority's flag also
 * being on (if geoV2 is off, there is no GeoSummary to consume no matter what this flag says).
 *
 * <p>Pure Java, no Minecraft imports -- this class belongs to the Core Logic layer per
 * {@code docs/porting/PORTABILITY_ARCHITECTURE.md}.
