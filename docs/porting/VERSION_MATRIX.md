# Latitude Version Matrix

`status: planning matrix`
`updated: 2026-07-06`

## Status update (2026-07-06, Fable 5 audit Slice A)

**The 26.2 pivot root IS the active Latitude line.** Since the section below froze (TEST 20 / HEAD
`61d51782`), the pivot has additionally landed the whole overhaul ladder behind default-off flags:
GeoAuthority/ClimateAuthority Phases 0-3, the Biome Consumer slice, and Phase 4 (terrain density wrapper,
`latitude.terrainV2.enabled`). Phase 4 is mechanically closed but NOT live-closed — the Fable 5 audit
measured an empty usable strength window on the current formula; a Y-aware taper is prerequisite. Current
truth: `../binder/fable5-overhaul-audit-report-20260706.md` (slices A–E, gates G1–G3). The 26.1.2 feature
branch is now a prior-era reference, not the active planning/source line.

## 26.2 Pivot Status (2026-07-02)

**GREEN for the deterministic-headless proof gate.** Build-metadata retarget + narrow API-drift repair are
done; `compileJava` is green (134 → 0 errors) and the headless Atlas proof runs green on 26.2.

- Toolchain: Gradle 9.5.1, Loom 1.17.13, Fabric Loader 0.19.3, Fabric API 0.154.0+26.2, MC 26.2, Java 25.
- `compileJava`: green.
- Headless Atlas (`runBiomePreview`): green — mod loads as `globe 2.0-beta.1+26.2`, mixins apply, biome export
  succeeds, distribution is banded and sane, and output is **deterministic** across consecutive runs (no
  seed/shape/radius leak).
- Full production `build`: green — `latitude-2.0-beta.1+26.2.jar` produced. Its mixin-apply structure
  (`"refmap"` declared, no standalone refmap file) is **identical to the live-proven 26.1.2 jar**, so mixins
  will apply in the Modrinth runtime the same way.
- The 134-error drift turned out to be mostly mechanical renames (screen state moved to `Gui.screen()`,
  `setScreen`→`setScreenAndShow`, camera/render-target getters, dripstone→speleothem feature renames) plus
  dead-code stubs — NOT the architectural wall the first pass feared. Full detail + before/after table in
  `docs/binder/canonical-26.2-pivot-20260702.md`.

**Live 26.2 client pass: DONE and extensive (2026-07-02/03).** What was the one open item above has since gone
through ~20 staged test jars (`TEST 1.jar` through `TEST 20.jar`) with Peetsa live-testing every round: the
initial client-mixin crash (`InGameHudMixin`→`Hud` retarget) was fixed and confirmed clean, followed by a long
polish arc across the World Creation screen (atlas frame, clipped scroll, tab strip, World Shape placement) and
a major HUD Studio feature buildout (biome/coords detachability, snap-to-grid toggle, a 4-tab redesign with RGB
color pickers for the compass AND the zone-enter title including a Rainbow option, letter-case and
letter-spacing controls, and a Rainbow Text option for the compass/zone/biome/coords readout). Every round
re-verified headless `runBiomePreview` byte-identical (all client-UI-only changes, zero worldgen impact). Full
narrative in `docs/binder/canonical-26.2-pivot-20260702.md`; the RGB/tabs/title/rainbow feature arc specifically
in `docs/binder/hud-studio-custom-theme-20260703.md` and `docs/binder/hud-studio-title-rainbow-and-polish-20260703.md`.

Remaining before release-ready (separate lanes): (1) no cross-version byte-identical flag-off diff (not
meaningful across MC versions); (2) an unrelated confirmed-dead parallel title-notification system
(`ZoneEntryNotifier`/`ui.ZoneTitleOverlay`) was found during the title-styling work and flagged for a follow-up
investigation, not yet resolved. NOTE: the earlier "frozen-river reflection" item was investigated and
is **not** a regression — that feature has been inert since before 26.1.2 (the `getFeatures` name never existed
in current mappings), so it was correctly left untouched to preserve behavior.

Root: `/Users/joolmac/CascadeProjects/Latitude-2.0-26.2-pivot`, branch `port/canonical-26.2-pivot`, HEAD `61d51782` (as of 2026-07-03 — see the 2026-07-06 status update above for what landed after).

This matrix records the intended port/pivot truth for Latitude work. Verify upstream metadata before implementation because Minecraft, Fabric API, Loader, and Loom move quickly.

## Current Planning Baseline

| Line | Minecraft | Role | Local status | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Latitude 2.0 overhaul | 26.2 | planned canonical target | pivot GREEN (compile + headless Atlas + live client pass) | Build metadata + narrow API-drift repair done; deterministic headless proof green; live client pass done across ~20 staged test jars (crash fix + World Creation polish + HUD Studio feature buildout). See pivot status above. |
| Latitude 2.0 prior feature branch | 26.1.2 | prior-era reference (superseded by the 26.2 pivot, 2026-07-06) | historical local branch | Superseded as the active line; use for behavioral comparison only. |
| Latitude 1.4 / early 2.0 reference | 26.1.2 | proven reference | local proof history exists | Use for behavioral comparison and regression baselines. |
| Older backport | 1.21.11 | backport target | structurally partial historically | Do not patch as primary without explicit Julia decision. |
| Older backport | 1.21.1 | backport target | historical port line | Requires scoped backport plan. |
| Older backport | 1.20.1 | backport target | hardest old line | Yarn/refmap/Java 17 risks. |
| Snapshot watch | 26.3 snapshots | watch only | not canonical | Track upstream, do not chase during 2.0 pivot. |

## 26.2 Public Metadata Snapshot

Verified during the 2026-07-02 planning pass:

- Minecraft Java `26.2` is the stable target.
- Fabric 26.2 guidance: Loom `1.17`, Gradle `9.5.1`, latest stable Loader `0.19.3`.
- Fabric API `0.154.0+26.2` is available.

## Local 26.1.2 Feature-Branch Metadata

At the planning pass, the active feature branch still used 26.1.2 metadata:

- `gradle.properties`: `minecraft_version=26.1.2`
- `gradle.properties`: `loader_version=0.18.4`
- `gradle.properties`: `fabric_api_version=0.145.4+26.1.2`
- `build.gradle`: Loom `1.15.5`
- `fabric.mod.json`: Minecraft dependency `>=26.1.2`

Do not update these values casually. The 26.2 pivot needs an isolated branch/worktree and deterministic proof.

## 26.2 Pivot Gate

The pivot becomes canonical only after:

- `compileJava` succeeds.
- Build metadata and `fabric.mod.json` agree.
- Mixin targets apply or are repaired.
- Headless Atlas proof runs.
- Exact-ID analyzer proof runs.
- Flag-off output is unchanged where applicable.
- Binder and porting docs record the new truth.

Until then, 26.2 is the planned canonical target, not a completed source truth.
