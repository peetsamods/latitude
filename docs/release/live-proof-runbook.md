# Latitude 1.4 Live Proof Runbook

`status: final live cruise green; release authorization pending` · `updated: 2026-06-21` · `current-candidate-sha256: 1f50c5954cef3c91de1b071e78172ad6940a41abe5bace3e6febde5ac449a477`

This runbook records the safe route and result for the final release cruise. It is not authorization for future Minecraft control by itself; live work still needs current Julia authorization and must follow exact Java-window discipline. The current staged profile/runtime candidate `1f50c595...` was rebuilt from savepoint `c9da0f93` and includes the desert locate fix, accepted stony-peaks tuning, and restored Y168/28 treeline. The 2026-06-21 live attempt proves launch/load/desert/soak/savequit, and a narrow follow-up proves current-world stony locate/HUD/server predicate.

## Hard Boundaries

- Do not use the vanilla Minecraft Launcher as a control surface.
- Do not use Computer Use against `Minecraft`, the vanilla Minecraft Launcher, or broad app-name matches.
- Do not type, click, press keys, focus, launch, quit, or send Minecraft commands until the exact Java-owned game window is proven.
- Do not mutate jars or profile files during this runbook. The staged profile jar must already match the candidate SHA below.
- Stop before savepoint, tag, push, upload, publication, or public release copy.

Current partial proof:
- Existing Itty save on `d51eace9...`: bespoke overlay rendered early, `first safe playable tick` logged, terrain rendered in exact-window screenshot.
- Promenade palm tint compat applied to 4 blocks on `d51eace9...`; `e09ea003...` contains the same source-level fix and latest log confirms the compat hook applied.
- Fresh SMALL `New Expedition` on `e09ea003...`: exact Java-window proof, `size=SMALL`, bespoke overlay first render, `first safe playable tick`, rendered terrain screenshot, and clean save/quit.
- Headless Itty Atlas on `e09ea003...`: seed `220220260619002`, radius `3750`, step `64`, 74 biomes across Minecraft, BoP, Terralith, and Promenade. This is non-live diversity evidence only, because Atlas sampling skips the live `previewHeight()` path.
- Live continuation on `e09ea003...`: exact Java-owned `Minecraft* 26.1.2` title-window proof existed, but the macOS session locked before safe gameplay proof could continue.
- Julia manual retest on `e09ea003...`: loading screen and chunk loading are green in the staged Modrinth profile.
- Current savepoint rebuild/stage evidence: `tmp/closeout-1.4-20260621/rebuild-c9da0f93-175345` and `tmp/closeout-1.4-20260621/profile-stage-c9da0f93-175416`.
- Historical launch blocker: Modrinth App had no visible macOS window and logged `theseus::state` initialization errors; this was superseded after Julia reopened Modrinth and the c9 candidate launched successfully.
- Current live result: exact Java-owned Minecraft window, c9 build line, existing `New World` load with `isGlobe=true`, 20,000-block border, command control, desert locate/HUD, short clean non-teleport soak, clean save/quit, and stony locate/HUD/server predicate are green.
- Remaining red/open/partial: no known live blocker; public version identity, branch/tag push, upload, publication, cleanup, and porting remain Julia-owned manual gates.

Record at minimum:

- repo preflight output for both roots
- `tools/lat-readiness-nonlive-status` output
- active profile jar list and SHA
- window identity proof
- screenshots for every accepted visual gate
- `latest.log` copy or excerpts covering `[LAT][BUILD]`, world state, warnings, commands, WARN/ERROR/Exception/crash counts, and `Can't keep up` counts
- final matrix update

## Control Gate

Before any gameplay action:

1. Prove the exact game window is a Java-owned `Minecraft* 26.1.2` window.
2. Reject any window whose title contains `Launcher` or `Modrinth`.
3. Take a window-targeted screenshot before typing or clicking.
4. If focus, title, screenshot, or log identity is ambiguous, stop the live run and report control as red.

Acceptable local helpers after explicit authorization:

```bash
tools/mc-window
tools/mc-focus
tools/mc-shot
tools/mc-wait-shot
tools/mc-chat
```

The helpers must be syntax-checked and `tools/mc-window --self-test` must pass before use.

Before any screenshot-driven live proof, confirm the macOS session is actually unlocked. If exact-window capture fails and the session state shows `CGSSessionScreenIsLocked=1` or the visible window list is dominated by `Display 1 Shield` / `loginwindow`, stop the live run and classify it as a locked-session blocker rather than a Minecraft control bug.

## Gate 1: Fresh And Existing Load Sanity

Purpose: prove a clean new-user path and one existing-save entry on the current staged SHA, not a deep re-investigation.

Required proof:

- `latest.log` or screenshot proves `1.4.1-beta.2+26.1.2` and candidate SHA/provenance where available.
- New `New Expedition` flow reaches a Latitude world, not a vanilla world.
- World identity proves `isGlobe=true`.
- Radius/border persist and match the selected world size.
- HUD/compass/settings do not occlude the proof.
- No first-load crash, hang, invisible world, stuck overlay, or obvious render failure.

If the first created world is not Latitude/globe, stop and diagnose that gate before scenic movement.

Result: PASS on current SHA `1f50c595...` for existing load sanity; fresh new-world creation was not rerun.

Accepted evidence:

- `tmp/readiness-1.4-candidate-20260618-live-20260618-211834/live/020-fresh-world-log-slice.txt`
- `tmp/readiness-1.4-candidate-20260618-live-20260618-211834/live/021-fresh-world-persistence-proof.txt`
- `tmp/readiness-1.4-candidate-20260618-live-20260618-211834/live/hud-compass-clean/006-clean-hud-compass-day.png`
- `tmp/readiness-1.4-candidate-20260618-live-20260618-211834/live/visual-audit-notes.md`

- `tmp/post-140-hardening-continuation-20260620-220852/live-continue-20260621/lock-state-current.txt`

Important: the current e09 world was named `Codex E09 Itty Smoke`, but the lifecycle log says `size=SMALL`. Julia's later manual retest, not that SMALL log, is the evidence that loading screen and chunk loading are green in the staged profile.

## Gate 2: Scenic, Palm, And Decoration Check

Purpose: prove that the prior scenic GREEN did not regress on the current SHA and capture the specific palm/fronds/decoration visual checks Julia asked to close.

Required proof:

- East/west haze or fog appears in the correct warning/danger zones, with screenshots close enough to inspect placement and intensity.
- East/west border warnings and distances match the world border.
- Representative latitude/biome bands still look coherent.
- Decoration density is sane: no confetti/noise/clutter regression, and tree-line/cherry-style signals remain plausible.
- HUD, compass, F3, and settings remain usable and do not hide critical proof.

This should be a bounded representative route, not another atlas investigation or full scenic repeat.

Result: PASS on current SHA `1f50c595...`; desert and tropics/decor visuals are supportive, and stony locate/HUD/server predicate is green after the narrow follow-up.

Accepted evidence:

- `tmp/readiness-1.4-candidate-20260618-live-20260618-211834/live/scenic-green-route-rerun4`
- `tmp/readiness-1.4-candidate-20260618-live-20260618-211834/live/scenic-green-route-rerun4/commands/046-west-danger-soak-summary.txt`
- `tmp/readiness-1.4-candidate-20260618-live-20260618-211834/live/visual-audit-notes.md`

## Gate 3: Non-Teleport Movement Soak

Purpose: add normal movement/performance evidence because the previous scenic proof was teleport-heavy.

Required proof:

- Move normally after chunks settle; avoid teleporting during the soak interval.
- Record duration, route summary, chunk/loading context, and visible FPS or jank notes where available.
- Count `Can't keep up`, WARN, ERROR, Exception, crash, and disconnect markers after the soak.
- Capture before/after screenshots and logs.

Any severe jank, crash, disconnect, terrain hole, persistent invisibility, or unreadable haze/HUD state is red until diagnosed.

Result: PASS on current SHA `1f50c595...`; 20-second W-key movement soak had zero new WARN/ERROR/crash lines.

Accepted evidence:

- `tmp/readiness-1.4-candidate-20260618-live-20260618-211834/live/nonteleport-soak/001-soak-start.png`
- `tmp/readiness-1.4-candidate-20260618-live-20260618-211834/live/nonteleport-soak/002-soak-end.png`
- `tmp/readiness-1.4-candidate-20260618-live-20260618-211834/live/nonteleport-soak/003-log-summary.txt`
- `tmp/post-140-hardening-continuation-20260620-220852/live-e09-log-review-after-static-soak.txt`
- `tmp/post-140-hardening-continuation-20260620-220852/live-e09-thread-dump-after-static-soak.txt`
- `tmp/post-140-hardening-continuation-20260620-220852/live-e09-vm-stat-after-static-soak.txt`

Previous e09 note: the fresh SMALL run logged three early two-second `Can't keep up` warnings, then no new log lines during the later static wait. Because another Java Minecraft client was running and system memory pressure was high, that was not a clean green soak for release closure.

## Gate 4: Save/Quit Shutdown

Purpose: prove that a current-SHA live run can save and return to title without the prior shutdown watchdog.

Result: PASS on current SHA `1f50c595...`; save/quit returned to title and logged all dimensions saved.

Accepted evidence:

- `tmp/post-140-hardening-continuation-20260620-220852/live-e09-savequit-log-final.txt`
- `tmp/post-140-hardening-continuation-20260620-220852/live-e09-crash-reports-after-savequit.txt`
- `tmp/post-140-hardening-continuation-20260620-220852/live-e09-after-savequit-final.png`

## Final Live Matrix

Completed updates after all live gates passed:

- `docs/release/current-readiness-audit.md`
- `docs/release/checklist.md`
- `/Users/joolmac/CascadeProjects/Latitude (Globe)/docs/release/checklist.md`
- `docs/binder/evidence-registry.md`

Savepoint/tag/push/upload/release rows remain manual and blocked until Julia separately authorizes that lane; the stony locate/HUD caveat is resolved by `tmp/closeout-1.4-20260621/stony-followup-c9-195009`.
