# Latitude Release Artifact Content Policy

`status: active` · `established: 2026-08-04` · `authority: Maintainer (owner directive)`

## Scope

This policy governs what may and may not be packaged inside a **public release artifact** of Latitude,
for every version and every port line, from 2026-08-04 forward. It supersedes the narrower rule recorded
in [`checklist.md`](./checklist.md) (the 1.4 line's "release jars exclude `com.example.globe.dev.*`,
so the shipping proof path is external tooling, not in-jar `/latdev`").

TEST artifacts are not release artifacts and are not governed here; they may carry the full development
surface under their existing artifact-identity gating.

## The rule

A public release artifact **ships** operator-usable Latitude commands, and **never** ships recording,
sentinel, or auto-harness work.

The exclusion exists for one reason: recording and sentinel work is the class of payload that can prevent
a public release from being greenlit. Keeping it out of the artifact is what keeps the greenlight
uncontestable. The exclusion is behavioral, not cosmetic — "it lives in a dev-named package" is not the
test, and neither is "it is only used by developers."

### Excluded class 1 — Recording

Anything that persists observations of a play session. The test: **does it write anything to disk, or
accumulate a record of what happened?**

Includes file writes of any kind (text, CSV, PNG, screenshots, clipboard capture), session/trace
accumulators, and export tooling. A command that produces the same information as transient chat output
is not recording; the moment it also writes a file, it is.

### Excluded class 2 — Sentinel

Anything that watches, waits, or acts on its own after the player's command returns. The test: **does it
install a tick listener, background job, watchdog, or budgeted worker that continues to act?**

Includes background chunk jobs, pregeneration and regeneration workers with tick budgets, audit
coordinators, and any pause/resume/status surface that exists to manage such a worker.

### Excluded class 3 — Auto-harness

Anything that arms itself without an explicit player command. The test: **can it start without a player
typing a command in the current play session?**

Includes auto-create/auto-close probes, client-side audit harnesses and bridges, keybind-triggered
capture, and `-D` system-property-driven headless runners.

### Permitted — synchronous operator queries

A command may ship when **all** of the following hold:

1. It runs synchronously and returns within the command call — no listener, job, or continuation.
2. Its entire output is chat text. It creates no files and no directories.
3. It requires operator permission (`Commands.hasPermission(Commands.LEVEL_GAMEMASTERS)`).
4. It cannot arm itself; it only runs when a player types it.

## Current classification

| Class | Members | In release artifact |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Permitted operator queries | `help`, `here`, `explainHere` (chat-only variant), `probe`, `tpLat`, `tpBand`, `flyspeed` | **Yes** |
| Recording | `DevTestSession` (`case`/`start`/`mark`/`capture`/`finish`), `DevPresentationTrace` (`presentationTrace`), `BiomePreviewExporter` (`biomePng`, `biomePngY`), `DevCaptureKeybind` + `ClipboardImageWriter`, `BiomePreviewHeadlessRunner`, `LatitudeDevCommand.writeExplainLog` | No |
| Sentinel | `ChunkPregenerator` jobs (`transect`, `transectDeg`, `slicePoleNS`, `pause`, `resume`, `stop`, `status`, `budgetMs`, `budgetAuto`), `ChunkRegenerator` (`regen`, `regenChunk`), `SeamAuditCoordinator` (`seamAudit`), `audit/AutonomousSeamAuditJob` | No |
| Auto-harness | `AutoCreateWorldProbe`, `client/SeamAuditClientBridge`, `client/audit/SeamAuditHarness` | No |

`explainHere` ships **only** with its file-writing path removed. The development variant writes
`run/latdev/explain/<timestamp>_x<X>_z<Z>.txt` and `latest.txt`; the shipped variant returns the same
content as chat output and touches no filesystem path.

### Root verb

The shipping surface is rooted at **`/latitude`**. `/latdev` remains development- and TEST-only.
Separate roots are deliberate: the two trees never have to merge at runtime, and a public artifact
does not advertise a development surface.

### Rulings on the boundary (owner, 2026-08-04)

- **Chunk generation is game state, not a record.** `tpLat` and `tpBand` force-generate the
  destination chunk, which persists region files. That is the same thing walking there would do, so
  it does not count as recording under excluded-class 1. Recorded here so the boundary is explicit
  rather than re-litigated each release.
- **`flyspeed` persistence is game state.** It writes the player's flying speed through Minecraft's
  own save path; it stores no observation.

## Enforcement points

These are mechanical and must be green for every release. They are deliberately redundant: no single
edit can quietly widen what ships.

1. **Package boundary.** Shipping commands live in `com.example.globe.tools`. Recording, sentinel, and
   auto-harness code lives in `com.example.globe.dev` and never moves out of it. A command that needs to
   ship gets *extracted*, not relocated wholesale.
2. **Packaging exclusion.** `build.gradle`'s `releaseArtifactExcludeSpec` keeps `com/example/globe/dev/**`
   (and `com/example/globe/debug/**`, `tools/**`, `scripts/**`, native/binary payload) out of `jar` and
   `remapJar`. This exclusion is never relaxed to ship a command; the command is extracted instead.
3. **Verifier assertions.** `tools/verify_phase6_dev_tooling.py` asserts that a public jar contains zero
   `com/example/globe/dev/**` entries, that it *does* contain the shipping `com/example/globe/tools/**`
   surface, and that shipping command sources contain no file-write, tick-listener, or harness references.
   Its `verify_tools_sources()` also pins the shipped subcommand and argument sets **exactly**, so an
   unknown new subcommand fails the gate rather than widening the surface silently.
6. **Build-enforced, not script-enforced.** `latitudeShippingToolsPolicyTest` and
   `latitudeArtifactPolicySourceScan` run under `check`. This repository has no CI, so a verifier that
   nothing invokes is not an enforcement point — the boundary has to be wired into the build itself.
7. **Registration containment.** Command registration exists only in `com.example.globe.tools` and
   `com.example.globe.dev`; no other package may reference Brigadier. A new command therefore cannot
   reach a release artifact without passing through the gated surface.
4. **Artifact identity.** A release artifact carries no `Latitude-Artifact-Role: TEST`, no
   `latitude:test_artifact` custom value, and `Build-Dirty: false`. `LatitudeDevRuntime`'s identity gate
   keeps TEST-only tooling inert in anything that is not a valid TEST artifact.
5. **Development-environment gates.** Client-side harnesses stay behind
   `FabricLoader.getInstance().isDevelopmentEnvironment()` in `GlobeModClient`, so they remain inert even
   if a class ever reaches a packaged artifact.

## Per-release verification

Run against the built candidate jar, before staging and again before publication:

```bash
unzip -l <candidate>.jar | grep -c "com/example/globe/dev/"    # must be 0
unzip -l <candidate>.jar | grep -c "com/example/globe/tools/"  # must be > 0
unzip -p <candidate>.jar META-INF/MANIFEST.MF                  # Build-Dirty: false, no Latitude-Artifact-Role
python3 tools/verify_phase6_dev_tooling.py --jar <candidate>.jar
```

Then, in a live session on the staged artifact: confirm the permitted commands exist and require operator
permission, confirm no excluded subcommand resolves, confirm no `run/latdev/` directory is created by any
shipped command, and confirm no Latitude capture keybind appears in the vanilla Controls list.

## Amendment protocol

This policy changes only by owner directive. Any amendment records a new evidence entry, scope
`release`, in the maintainer's notes directory for this line (outside the repository; its
location is recorded in the maintainer's private agent configuration) — never in this tree —
sets `supersedes` to the prior entry, and updates this document in the same
pass. Prior text is superseded, never rewritten — the history of what shipped under which rule
stays readable.
