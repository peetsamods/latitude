- [~] DISCARDED (2026-06-06, Julia): "First-load message appears on NEW world only" — stale/obsolete item. The bespoke loading overlay intentionally shows on both new and existing Latitude saves. World-entry render-gate (overlay holds until render-ready) + latitude early-spawn landed & live-verified — tag `save/world-entry-render-gate-early-spawn`.
- [x] PASS: ./gradlew -PenableInvariantScan latitudeInvariantScan (2026-06-06 — after first-load-message discard `eec31d79` removed the stale DownloadingTerrain invariant lock)
- [ ] PASS: No fog/EW/HUD render diffs in this release
