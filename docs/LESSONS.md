# Latitude Lessons

`scope: durable project lessons` · `status: active` · `updated: 2026-06-18`

This is the short "do not relearn this" file for Latitude. It is not the session log. The dated session log stays in `docs/binder/`, and the live resume pointer stays in `docs/HANDOFF.md`.

Read this before any non-trivial Latitude implementation, proof, release, or port/backport work.

## How To Use This File

- Start with the current `docs/HANDOFF.md`, then read only the lesson sections that match the slice.
- Treat a lesson as a preflight check, not as history trivia.
- Add a new lesson when a real mistake, false start, or costly rediscovery would likely happen again.
- Keep entries short: trigger, lesson, required future behavior, and evidence pointer.
- Do not use this file for dated narration. Put chronology and proof details in `docs/binder/`.

## L1 - 26.1.2 Is Canon For Latitude 1.4

Trigger: any question about whether to continue 1.21.11, move to 26.2, or backport 1.4 behavior.

Lesson: Minecraft 26.1.2 is the current canonical Latitude 1.4 line. Minecraft 1.21.11, 1.21.1, and 1.20.1 are backport targets. Minecraft 26.2 is a later evaluation target, not the current source of truth.

Required future behavior:
- Finish and prove the 26.1.2 source of truth before ordinary older-version backports.
- Do not patch 1.21.11 as if it is primary unless Julia explicitly reopens that structure.
- Any older-version work needs a scoped backport plan and proof gate.

Evidence:
- `docs/HANDOFF.md`
- `docs/binder/canonical-26-1-2-decision-20260618.md`
- `docs/binder/1211-province-gap-and-structure-question-20260614.md`

## L2 - Backports Need A Subsystem Manifest

Trigger: any port/backport from 26.1.2 to 1.21.11, 1.21.1, or 1.20.1.

Lesson: A backport is not "copy the latest patch." Latitude features are made of systems that can diverge by version. The 1.21.11 quality gap happened because the port had some v1.4 behavior but not `ProvinceAuthority`.

Required future behavior:
- Before code changes, list the donor system and every target subsystem included or excluded.
- Check both directions: what canonical has that the port lacks, and what the port has that canonical lacks.
- Mark partial backports honestly. A documented partial is better than an ad-hoc "almost v1.4" port.

Minimum subsystem manifest:
- `ProvinceAuthority` and warm/province coherence
- equator dry-biome demotion
- cherry / sakura / pale garden gates
- tree-line / alpine / snow-cap behavior
- custom-biome source wrapping and tags
- `/latdev` and proof commands
- client HUD, warning, and loading-overlay behavior
- release/profile/jar metadata

- `/Users/joolmac/CascadeProjects/Latitude-port-1.4.0-1.21.11/docs/porting/HANDOFF-1.21.11-state-and-province-gap-20260614.md`
- `/Users/joolmac/CascadeProjects/Latitude-custom-biome-expansion-26.1.2/docs/porting/HANDOFF-1.4-beta-backport.md`

## L3 - Root, Branch, Profile, And Jar Are Part Of The Proof

Trigger: any build, live proof, release-readiness check, Modrinth profile change, or port validation.

Lesson: Latitude work has repeatedly lost time to stale assumptions about which checkout, branch, profile, or jar is active.

Required future behavior:
- Run repo preflight before modifying a repo.
- For live or release checks, record a truth table first:
  - repo root
  - branch and HEAD
  - Minecraft version
  - Modrinth profile path
  - active Latitude jar name/version/hash if relevant
  - whether the surface is development truth, candidate truth, or public-release truth
- Do not run proof against "whatever jar is in the profile."

Evidence:
- `docs/HANDOFF.md`
- `/Users/joolmac/CascadeProjects/Latitude-port-1.4.0-1.21.11/CODEX_CRUISE_CONTROL.md`

## L4 - Proof Types Must Stay Separate

Trigger: any claim of green, done, release-ready, or port-complete.

Lesson: compile proof, atlas proof, branch-client launch, Modrinth live proof, and release publication are different gates. One does not imply the others.

Required future behavior:
- State exactly what the proof checks and what it does not check.
- Keep partial `runClient` or launch evidence partial until title screen, world entry, and intended observations exist.
- Use atlas/headless proof for biome distribution and structural worldgen checks.
- Use Modrinth/live proof for HUD, overlays, visual feel, render path, profile jar behavior, and anything the dev client cannot drive reliably.

Evidence:
- `/Users/joolmac/CascadeProjects/Latitude-port-1.4.0-1.21.11/CODEX_CRUISE_CONTROL.md`
- `/Users/joolmac/CascadeProjects/Latitude-port-1.4.0-1.21.11/docs/porting/beta26-palegarden-atlas-proof-20260610.md`

## L5 - Use Exact-ID Atlas Evidence For Confetti And Biome Mix

Trigger: any judgment about confetti, arid leakage, equatorial variety, missing biomes, or biome over/under-representation.

Lesson: natural-color map screenshots can mislead. Exact biome-ID outputs and band analyzers carry the real signal.

Required future behavior:
- Prefer `biome_ids.png`, `biome_palette.json`, distinct-ID renderers, and band metrics for biome-distribution claims.
- Use natural `biomes.png` as visual context, not final proof.
- Keep exact commands and output paths in binder evidence when a savepoint or release depends on the result.

Evidence:
- `/Users/joolmac/CascadeProjects/Latitude-custom-biome-expansion-26.1.2/docs/porting/HANDOFF-1.4-beta-backport.md`
- `/Users/joolmac/CascadeProjects/Latitude-custom-biome-expansion-26.1.2/docs/binder/atlas-viewer-modernization-brief-20260605.md`

## L6 - Do Not Move Altitude Rules Back Into Latitude Blindly

Trigger: any proposal to use height-above-local-surface, vertical ecology, raised cloud decks, krummholz, or Altitude-style terrain behavior in Latitude.

Lesson: Altitude and Latitude solve different problems. Altitude uses height-above-local-surface; Latitude's current tree-line canon is absolute-Y near the cloud deck.

Required future behavior:
- Keep Latitude's current cloud-relative tree-line semantics unless Julia explicitly reopens the product design.
- Share utilities or amplitude machinery only when the behavior boundary stays clear.
- Do not let Altitude identity leak into Latitude release scope.

Evidence:
- `/Users/joolmac/CascadeProjects/Altitude/docs/binder/lessons-from-altitude-into-latitude-20260608.md`

## L7 - Use A Working Card Before Non-Trivial Work

Trigger: any non-trivial code, docs, proof, port, release, or live-client slice.

Lesson: broad requests are normal. Julia should not have to translate them into safe engineering slices. Codex must do that work before acting.

Required future behavior:
- Write or state a six-line working card before risky or multi-step work:
  - Objective:
  - Root/profile:
  - Allowed work:
  - Forbidden lanes:
  - Proof gate:
  - Stop condition:
- If the symptom or target changes, rewrite the working card before patching or delegating.

Evidence:
- Local workflow audit on 2026-06-18.
